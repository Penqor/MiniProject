        What we have seen of Virtual Reality so far is only the tip of the iceburg. In the future Virtual Reality could become a part of modern day video games and be a part of our normal lives. Virtual Reality is going to continue to become more realistic as time goes on. This means rather than just seeing things we will be able feel, touch and maybe smell different objects and things in a virtual enviroment.
